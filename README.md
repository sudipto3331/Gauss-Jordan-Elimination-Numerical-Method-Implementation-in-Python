# Gauss-Jordan-Elimination-Numerical-Method-Implementation-in-Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Gauss-Jordan Elimination method for solving systems of linear equations. The code reads coefficients from an Excel file (`read.xls`), performs Gauss-Jordan Elimination to reduce the matrix to reduced row echelon form, and saves the results back into the Excel file.
